The decision problem for a property is solvable if there is a mechanical test which, applied to \textit{any} object of the appropriate sort, eventually (after a finite number of steps) classifies that object correctly as a positive or negative instance of that property. In first order logic the decision problem deals with validity and satisfiability of sentences. We will prove that there does not exist a mechanical negative test for deciding if a sentence in first order logic is valid. In this presentation, we will demonstrate that if there existed such a routine, it would imply that we could mechanically determine whether a Turing machine will eventually halt. Since we know this is not possible, there can be no mechanical routine to determine validity.
